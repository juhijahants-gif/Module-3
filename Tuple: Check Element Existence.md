# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element 'n' and the element 8 exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple x with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the in operator to check if the string 'n' exists within the tuple.
3. Use the in operator to check if the integer 8 exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
```
x = ('a', 'n', 'g', 'e', 'l', 8, 9, 3)
print('n' in x)
print(8 in x)
```

## Result
The program successfully checks for the existence of both the character 'n' and the number 8 in the given tuple and prints True for each, confirming their presence.
